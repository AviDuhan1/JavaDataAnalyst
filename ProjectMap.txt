This program will import datasets (eventually in various formats), decide which statistical test is most appropriate, and then run that statistical test.
There will be functions for importing datasets, exporting datasets(?), removing outliers (or at least an option to do so), deducing which variables in a dataset are statistically significant, deciding which tests are most appropriate for the dataset,
and running those tests on that dataset. Furthermore, features for analyzing correlation between variables will be available.
(NOTE: this project is in early alpha, so more features or changes to features are to come)

Project Steps:
1. Figure out how to import datasets into Java in a way where they are usuable.
	1a. Start out with one datafile type (IE xml), and then expand outward from there once the other features are working.
2. Figure out how to trim outliers from a dataset, and implement a function that will do so.
3. Create a function to see if stepwise regression (or another form of deciding which variables are significant) is valid.
	3a. This will involve creating a function which tests a dataset for normality.
4. Create a function that performs stepwise regression (or otherwise) on the dataset itself to determine validity of variables.
5. Create functions that decide whether or not a specific test is valid for a given dataset
	5a. This includes t-test, z-test, etc... with options for one-tailed and two-tailed included
	5b. Create a master function that runs each of these on a dataset.
	5c. Given which tests (if any) are valid, return the most "powerful" test possible that can be run on that dataset.
6. Create a function which runs a given statistical test based on which test was chosen.
7. Create a function which takes two variables and a dataset as inputs and determines how correlated those two variables are.
